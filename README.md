<!-- Main Text body-->

## I want this, but what do I download?

What I reccomend is downloading the latest release in this repository. This is becasue the main branch of this repo has pre-releases and they can be sketchy sometimes.

---

## SWF Files

Flash files used with [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) on the ISD279 Games website. A catalogue of them can be found [here](/swf/catalogue.md).

---

## Broken SWF Files

These are flash files that I am wating for [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) to support or to be fixed.

---

## ROMs

Roms for various emulators on ISD279 Games. Here is an [index of them](/roms/roms.md). I plan on adding more later but there is not a large enough demand for them currently to deem them worth my time (TL;DR I'm lazy and didn't want to add them because there's no demand for them).
