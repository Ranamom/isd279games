# ISD279Games - Version 1.5

These are external resources for the website isd279games found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/isd-279-games). (The URL may change but I will update this one)

## SWF Files

Flash files used with [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) on the ISD279 Games website. A catalogue of them can be found [here](/swf/catalogue.md).

## Broken SWF Files

These are flash files that I am wating for [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) to support or to be fixed.

## ROMs

Roms for various emulators on ISD279 Games. Here is an [index of them](/roms/roms.md). I plan on adding more later but there is not a large enough demand for them currently to deem them worth my time (TL;DR I'm lazy and didn't want to add them because there's no demand for them).

## Other Games

- MineKhan - A JavaScript version of Minecraft. This is unused on the main site because it has several problems with the rendering of the game. However, it can be found [here](https://reedgraf.github.io/isd279games/MineKhan.html) as a demo and the source can be found [here](https://github.com/Willard21/MineKhan).
- Rooftop Snipers - A game where you shoot an opponent off of a roof with various weapons on an ever changing building.
- Spider Solitaire - A card game made in HTML5, a working demo can be found [here](https://reedgraf.github.io/isd279games/spider-solitaire/index.html) and the source [here](https://github.com/leapfroglets/spider-solitaire).
