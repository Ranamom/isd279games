## End of Life

There will be no more updates to this repo. I was pulled aside while in school about the website and I cannot continue updating/hosting the site. What remains is at [https://sites.google.com/view/3-isd279games](https://sites.google.com/view/3-isd279games)

<!-- Main Text body-->

## I want this, but what do I download?

What I recommend is downloading the latest release in this repository. This is because the main branch of this repo has pre-releases and they can be sketchy sometimes.

## SWF Files

Flash files used with [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) on the ISD279 Games website. A catalogue of them can be found [here](/swf/catalogue.md).

---

## Broken SWF Files

These are flash files that I am waiting for [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) to support or to be fixed. A catalogue of them can be found [here](/broken-swf/catalogue.md)

## ROMs

Roms for various emulators on ISD279 Games. Here is an [index of them](/roms/roms.md).
